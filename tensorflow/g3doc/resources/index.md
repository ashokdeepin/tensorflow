## What is TensorFlow used for?

TensorFlow enables researchers to build machine learning models. We collect such
models in our [Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models). If you have built a 
model with TensorFlow, you may consider publishing it there.

We keep a list of projects that use TensorFlow [here](uses.md). If you made
something amazing with TensorFlow, we'd like to hear about it!

## Community

The TensorFlow community has created many great projects around TensorFlow, including:

* [TensorFlow tutorials](https://github.com/pkmital/tensorflow_tutorials)
* [Scikit Flow - Simplified Interface for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/skflow)

### Development
